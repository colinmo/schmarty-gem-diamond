  <dt>How do I add my website to the webring?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Joining the webring is a two-part process.
      <ol>
        <li>Sign in using your personal site's domain as your identity. The webring works with sites that support <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a> or <a href="https://indieweb.org/RelMeAuth">RelMeAuth</a>.</li>
        <li>Add your site's unique <strong>webring links</strong> to your homepage. You can always find your links in the <a href="/dashboard#webring-links">Your Webring Links section</a> of the <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard page</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What are <strong>webring links</strong>?</dt>
  <dd><p>
    These links appear on the home page of each member of the webring, and allow visitors of member sites to continue exploring other sites in the webring. These links are <em>how the webring works</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to prevent "breaking the ring", member sites are checked periodically to make sure the webring links are still on their homepage. If the links are missing, your site will be marked as inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
    Members can re-scan their home page for webring links at any time from the <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard page</a>.
